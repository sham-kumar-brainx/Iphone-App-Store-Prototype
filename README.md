## MVC Architecture

The **Iphone App Store Prototype** follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Displays the user interface and receives user inputs.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user inputs and updating the Model accordingly.

## UIKit Framework

The **Iphone App Store Prototype** is built using Apple's UIKit framework, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

## Collection View

The project utilizes the Collection View component to efficiently display and manage collections of items in various layouts. This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive interfaces for showcasing images, products, or any type of data.

## Table View

Table View is employed in the project to present structured data in a tabular format with rows and sections. It offers a standardized way to organize and display information, making it suitable for lists of contacts, messages, and more.

## Diffable Data Source

The Diffable Data Source is used in conjunction with Collection Views and Table Views to provide efficient and automatic updates to the UI based on changes in the underlying data. This makes managing complex data sets and maintaining a responsive user interface much simpler.

## XIBs

The project leverages XIB files for interface design. XIBs allow for creating individual interface components or views, supporting a modular approach to UI design. By utilizing XIBs, the project maintains a separation of concerns and enhances the reusability of UI elements.
